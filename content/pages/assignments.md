Oral Presentations
------------------

You will give five different types of presentations of varying lengths during the term. Some of these will be given in class. Others will be given in oral presentation labs, which take place outside of class time with a few other students and an instructor or TA.

Each of your presentations will be recorded. Within two days after your presentation, you will be asked to provide a short bulleted list pointing out what you liked about the presentation, and the things you want to strengthen.
